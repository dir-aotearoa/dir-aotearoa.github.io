<h3 id="preamble">Preamble <a class="direct-link" href="#preamble">#</a></h3>
<p>The purpose of this committee is to bring together experts, communities and organisations involved in the production, measurement, collection, storage, and use of data in research. The term “research” is interpreted broadly, and includes aspects of data use in business and industry.</p>
<p>Research is increasingly interdisciplinary, as illustrated by global grand challenges of the kind embodied in the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the Sendai Framework (2015-2030), Paris Climate Agreement (UNFCC 2015), and the Habitat III New Urban Agenda (United Nations Habitat III 2016), and this requires the development of new connections between people and between organisations. Sharing best practice and building relationships, both nationally and internationally, will add value to the work that we do, and open up new opportunities for collaborative research with enhanced benefit to Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
<p>The Committee will foster a sense of community among those interested in Data. The Committee and its community should have a clarity of purpose and a shared vision that reflects the values and principles embodied in Te Tiriti o Waitangi, all the way from gathering, measuring, storing, to using and reusing data, and everything in between.</p>
<h3 id="terms-of-reference">Terms of Reference <a class="direct-link" href="#terms-of-reference">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>To provide a forum for interdisciplinary discussion and inter-organisation communication on data in research;</li>
<li>To promote principles, policies and practices for Open Data, FAIR data, Open Science, and CARE principles for Indigenous data governance, particularly within the context of Te Tiriti o Waitangi, Māori data sovereignty, and collective well-being;</li>
<li>To link Aotearoa New Zealand to global practices and advances in data quality, measurement, management, analysis, curation and preservation, through cultivating relationships with and membership of appropriate international organisations and projects;</li>
<li>To ensure that Aotearoa New Zealand has a voice and a role in the global development of the ethical use of data in research, and Indigenous data sovereignty;</li>
<li>To promote the adoption of best practices by researchers working with data in Aotearoa New Zealand;</li>
<li>To organise and promote activities such as workshops and panels, to promote national and international collaborations and to raise awareness of policies, technologies, infrastructure and best practices in data in Aotearoa New Zealand;</li>
<li>To contribute to the development of strategic policy advice on the production, collection, storage, dissemination, sharing, and use of data in research;</li>
<li>This document should be reviewed at least annually by both the Committee and the forum/reference group.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="functional-responsibilities">Functional Responsibilities <a class="direct-link" href="#functional-responsibilities">#</a></h3>

The Committee should then make a recommendation to the annual meeting of the forum/reference group on the Committee membership for the next year;</li>
<li>The Committee should be diverse in its make-up, cover a wide range of sectors interested in Data in Research, and change at least a quarter of its members each year.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="meetings">Meetings <a class="direct-link" href="#meetings">#</a></h3>
