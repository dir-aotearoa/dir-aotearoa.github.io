The establishment group will be recommending to the new committee that an early career group be established within the forum, and this idea did have some influence on our recommendation.</p>\n<p>We wish to emphasise that the terms of reference for the committee specify a regular turn-over of membership, and we anticipate that applicants who have been unsuccessful in this round or any other members of the wider forum will join the committee in future.</p>\n<p>We have called the meeting of the wider forum, with a view to securing your approval of our recommendations, and we hope that you will be able to attend that meeting and participate in the work taken on by the forum.</p>\n<p>Ngā mihi<br>\nRichard Hartshorn</p>\n",
