Research Data Culture Conversation

After developing a baseline of Research Data in Aotearoa in 2023 with the help of Australian RDCC colleagues, we attempted to repeat the exercise in order to determine a growth rate of research data. These results were shared at eResearch NZ in February 2024, indicating a growth rate of about ~25% indicating there was likely 56 PB of research data holdings as of December 2023. This is in line with our Australian colleagues who have measured ~30 % growth rates over the last 5 years or so. Though it's important to note with fewer institutes contributing, the margin of error will be large. Slides from the BoF session, held with Australian RDCC colleagues are available to view: Making research data count.

A second and related BoF was also held at eResearch NZ, Unravelling the data lifecycle. Based on recent work carried out in Australia, as part of the Institutional Underpinnings program of the ARDC. Depicted here as “unravelling” the life cycle diagram, the challenges exposed relate to the nature of the decisions that drive data curation, retention, and disposal in each life cycle stage. Both sessions had good attendance and some lively debate over the idea of deleting research data. Related to this, there is a proposed RDA working group - Active disposal of research data: what you need to know and do before you push delete at the upcoming RDA virtual plenary 22.

Next steps for the RDCC in both Australia and New Zealand are currently being decided based on the feedback received from the broader community, with Australia currently in talks with CAUDIT and AeRO. There has also been momentum around understanding the role of data stewardship in the context of Institutional Research data holdings.

From the New Zealand side, Claire Rye and Nick Jones from NeSI have been leading the kōrero and would be keen to engage further with interested members of the data community. Please reach out to claire.rye@nesi.org.nz.
